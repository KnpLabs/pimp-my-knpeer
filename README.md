# pimp my knpeer

## Context 

This is a small React project which allows you to create and download an avatar. It is a Toy project created during the two last KNPHackatons. 

## What about?

Create an app so that each knpeer can make his own personalized avatar.
This is a project we already started at the last Hackathon. The goal is to learn react and make an app to generate avatars for KNPeers.
